Domain layer: is consider the most stable layer 

the core business logic is written here 

we have repository, entities and use cases in this layer 

why we have repository in domain layer and data layer :
because of the principle of separation, according to this 
domain layer should not be dependant on any layer, so if use cases
has to call  the repository present in the data layer 
is depending on the data layer, so this will create a problem
so due to this we create the interface for repository
