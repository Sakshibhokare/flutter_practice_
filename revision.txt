widgets and widgets lifecycle 

1. widget is something that every class that can be called 
in the build function 
2. build function is used to render something on the screen

3. every flutter app is the combination of two widgets 
stateless and stateful 
stateless widget are those widget where the state once created and can not be changed
stateful widgets are widgets those can change the state 

lifecycle of the widgets 
in case of stateless widget we create the constructor and then call the build function

in case of stateful widget after the constructor we have createState function then build function 


we have initstate function to initialise the state 

we have dispose function to remove something to clear the app memory
